My name is Yovina Silvia. I'm looking for new challenges and opportunities!

ðŸ“š I'm currently learning Data Engineering with a strong interest in this field.
ðŸŽ“ For three months, I attended the Immersive Program at Alterra Academy for Data Engineering. During the program, I have learned to build data pipelines, both ETL and ELT, and gained hands-on experience with tools and technologies such as Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Airbyte, Airflow, and DBT. I also explored additional data engineering tools like Spark, Kafka, and Docker, and deepened my understanding of data warehousing and cloud solutions such as Google Cloud Platform.

Feel free to connect with me!
